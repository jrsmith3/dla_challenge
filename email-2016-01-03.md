John,
I have completed the challenge and posted the writeup to my github account as a jupyter notebook [1]. I have the TK1 and I can return it whenever is convenient.

The details of how I set up the TK1 are in the report, but briefly, the `dla_challenge` repo is cloned in my user's home directory at `/home/jrsmith3/Documents/dla_challenge`. The parameters in the file `tec_nn.py` can be adjusted and the code can be run after the conda environment is activated. Please see the report for more details.

I also included the passwords for both user accounts on the TK1 and put the printout in the box.

I had some trouble with my original idea, and so I included a more successful example problem in the report. 

My original idea was to train the neural network to approximate the function implemented by the `tec` module (see the report for more detail). However, given the timeframe, I was not able to get the neural net to converge on a good approximation and I couldn't sufficiently reverse engineer the neural network code I was using to yield a solution.

I included a writeup of the results in the report because I am personally interested in that problem and it also demonstrates the kind of complex computing problem I am interested in and capable of working on.

Please feel free to email, call, or open issues on the `dla_challenge` github tracker if you have any questions about the code. I look forward to hearing what you think.

Best,
Joshua
