John,
I posted the writeup to the challenge to my github account as a jupyter notebook [1]. I have the TK1 and I can return it whenever is convenient.

The details are all in the report, but I cloned the repo on the TK1 in my user's home directory. There's some code I exported from the notebook that can be run from the command prompt of the TK1 if you are interested. I also printed out the passwords for both users on the TK1 and I put the printout in the box.

I had some trouble with my original idea, and so I included a more successful example problem in the report.
